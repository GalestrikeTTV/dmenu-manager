# mandwm-api
A helper crate for mandwm, offering macros and easy ways of interfacing with mandwm within external applications.

mandwm-api will have logging functions, IPC for other applications, helper functions for Rust scripts within mandwm, and also serves as a base for mandwm-ffi.

mandwm-api must be completed after mandwm's core functionality is created, so it will remain mostly empty.
